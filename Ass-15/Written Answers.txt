Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.
GET requests are intended to retrieve data from a server and do not modify the server's state. On the other hand, POST requests are used to send data to the server for processing and may modify the server's state.


Q2. Why is request used in Flask?
In a Flask App, we have our own Webpage (Client) and a Server. The Server should process the data. The Request, in Flask, is an object that contains all the data sent from the Client to Server. This data can be recovered using the GET/POST Methods.


Q3. Why is redirect() used in Flask?
The redirect() function is used in Flask to redirect the user to a different URL. It is commonly used when handling web application routes to send the user to a different page after a certain action has been taken, such as logging in or submitting a form.



Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?
The render_template() function is used to render a template file. It takes the name of the template file as its first argument and a dictionary of variables as its second argument. The variables in the dictionary are made available to the template file.
Here is an example of a template file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Flask App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
</body>
</html>
